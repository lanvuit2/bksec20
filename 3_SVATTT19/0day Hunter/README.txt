[Description]: Someone said that he has found a crash in my fileinfo.exe program with his custom fuzzer, but he can't recover the test case. Can you help me to make a seed file that helps the fuzzer reproduce the crash.

To start the fuzzer:
 + Put the seed file in to `seeds` folder
 + Run `fuzz.bat` script
